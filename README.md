## Inspiration

Latin Wordle is a free and open-source project that aims to provide a fun and interactive way to learn Latin. I was inspired by the real version (linked above), and decided to make my own version for latindictionary.io.
Please feel free to contribute to the project, and if you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Forking This Repo

There are no copyright restrictions on this project, so feel free to fork and use it for your own purposes.

### Tech Stack

This project was built using React, Typescript, and [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/). React and TypeScript were chosen because I am trying to learn React and TypeScript, and I figured it would be a good fit for this project. I used Tailwind because it fits amazingly with React and the Just-In-Time compiler that it uses to reduce the client bundle size.

### To Run Locally

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$ cd latin-wordle
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
